# Work

A work is a distinct, notable literary creation. The work entity captures
information about the *content* that was created, not any physical or digital
representation.

## Distinctiveness

A work is considered distinct based on the substantive uniqueness of its
content. A work is distinct from another if it is revised, adapted, translated
or reconstructed. Content is not considered a distinct work if it only
contains minor variations such as spelling or typographical differences.

Sometimes content is integral to a work and is not considered distinct from
it. In general, chapters of a novel are *not* considered to be their own
distinct works. Poems, essays, articles and short stories *are* generally
considered distinct works.

## Naming

The name of a work should be its canonical title, in the language it was
written by its author, or translator for translated works. Additional names,
such as descriptive titles, known variations or transliterations should be
included as aliases.

The language of a work’s name can differ from the language of the actual work.
For example, a work written in English can have a Latin name. The name of the
work should be capitalized based on the rules of the language of its name.

## Untitled works

If a work does not have a title, the name of the work should be the first line
or sentence of the work’s text, enclosed in square brackets. Do not apply
capitalization rules; retain the case of the original text. Examples:

- [[At that hour when all things have repose]](https://bookbrainz.org/work/c0b50c4b-d57d-43bf-83b2-4930d938a0e4)
- [[Rash mortal! stay thy feet and look around]](https://beta.bookbrainz.org/work/ed6d8c28-fe3c-4fde-b399-6663c2225805)

The sort name of an untitled work should be the same name, omitting the square
brackets.

## Writer

The primary relationship of a work is to its main author, aka its *writer*;
every work should have at least one writer.

A work’s writer can be a special-purpose author in specific cases:

- *Anonymous writer*. If a work cannot be attributed to a specific writer
(e.g. published anonymously or writer attribution has been irrecoverably lost)
it should be related to
[[anonymous]](https://bookbrainz.org/author/fd47e471-a994-4ed9-bf52-531d5f184dd3).
- *Unknown writer*. If the author of a work is currently unknown, but can
potentially be determined at a later date, it should be related to
[[unknown]](https://bookbrainz.org/author/6c1b8f55-4c7e-4739-bfa2-1979da4c68e1). 
- *Oral tradition*. If a work has been preserved in the oral tradition (e.g.
received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another) it
should be related to
[[traditional]](https://beta.bookbrainz.org/author/415a1f7c-a793-4107-9f2f-c38caf15116d).

## Translations

Each translation of a work is distinct from the original work as well as from
any other translation. A translated work should be related to the original
work as a translation, have a *writer* relationship to the original work’s
author, and a *translator* relationship to its translator. Example:

- [Republic](https://bookbrainz.org/work/c1b11cb0-38b0-49ea-88e8-83566c5589ad) was
written by [Πλάτων](https://bookbrainz.org/author/3efc11ba-87ae-4cd0-9677-373f7618925a)
- [Republic](https://bookbrainz.org/work/c1b11cb0-38b0-49ea-88e8-83566c5589ad) is
a translation of [Πολιτεία](https://bookbrainz.org/work/40002c97-41df-4659-b0e0-b30dfa5cbc59)
- [Republic](https://bookbrainz.org/work/c1b11cb0-38b0-49ea-88e8-83566c5589ad) was
translated by [Benjamin Jowett](https://bookbrainz.org/author/dc98466f-9e81-4fb1-a714-3b62b625b455)

If the translator is unknown or unidentified, the translator should be
[[unknown]](https://bookbrainz.org/author/6c1b8f55-4c7e-4739-bfa2-1979da4c68e1).

Notable information about a translation should be documented in the work’s
annotation.

## Work relationships

A work should be related to another work if:

- *it is derived from another work*, for example: a translation, an
adaptation, a revision, a reconstruction, a parody, an inspiration;
- *it contains the content from another work or is contained in another work*,
for example: a [fix-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fix-up), a poetry cycle,
an excerpt, a quote;
- *it references another work*, for example: a citation.

Except for cases such as a fix-up or a poetry cycle as mentioned above, a discrete work should not represent a collection of works.
