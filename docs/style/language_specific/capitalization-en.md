2. Nouns are always capitalized.
3. Verbs are always capitalized.
4. Adjectives are always capitalized.
5. Adverbs are always capitalized.
6. Words consisting of more than four letters are always capitalized.
7. Unless the first or last words of the title, articles (a, an, the), conjunctions (and, but, nor, or), prepositions fewer than five letters long, infinitives (to), the word "as", or "o'Clock" are never capitalized.
8. Although fewer than five letters long, also, be, if, than, that, thus, when are always capitalized.

Differences against Music Titles
---------------
Although many of the rules overlap between book titles and release titles, there are a few distictions to be made.

1. Firstly, music style guidelines state that prepositions fewer than four letters long are never capitalized. In book titles, it is standard for prepositions fewer than five letters long to never be capitalized. For example, the words "like" and "near" would not be capitalized for books.
2. Secondly, a special case. For book titles, the word "o'Clock" never has the first portion capitalized, but both parts are capitalized in music titles.
