# Disambiguation

A disambiguation is used to help users distinguish between entities that have
identical or confusingly similar names. Disambiguation values are visible in
search results and entity detail pages. When including a disambiguation, it
should be written in English and kept fairly short.

## When to use disambiguation

1.  If two or more entities of the same type contain an identical name.
    <br/><br/>

2.  If two or more entities of the same type contain names where homonyms,
    grammatical articles, punctuation or plurality differ.

## When *not* to use disambiguation

1.  To provide a description of an entity that is not ambiguous. Use
    annotations to provide such descriptions.
    <br/><br/>

2. To distinguish entities of different types. Existing cues in the user
    interface already address this.

## Disambiguation content

### For works

1.  *Different authors*. If the name of a work is ambiguous with the work of
    another author, the disambiguation should contain the name of the author
    and the work type. Examples:

    - Misery (Anton Chekov short story)
    - Misery (Stephen King novel)

2.  *Translated work*. If a work has been translated from its original
    language and is ambiguous with the work of the same author, the
    disambiguation should indicate the language of the translation. Examples:

    - Madame Bovary (French) ← *original work*
    - Madame Bovary (German translation) ← *translated work*

    If the work has been translated to the same language by different
    translators, indicate the language and translator in the disambiguation.
    Example:

    - Madame Bovary (English: Alan Russell)
    - Madame Bovary (English: Eleanor Marx)

3.  *Identically named work and type by same author*. If an author produces
    ambiguously named works of identical type, the disambiguation should
    contain the name of the author, work type and some descriptive text.
    Examples:

    - In Memoriam (Voltairine de Cleyre poem to Dyer D. Lum)
    - In Memoriam (Voltairine de Cleyre poem to Gen. M. M. Trumbull)

    If no descriptive information is apparent, quote the first words of the
    text. Examples:

    - Justice (Ambrose Bierce poem “Jack Doe met Dick Roe”)
    - Justice (Ambrose Bierce poem “She jilted me”)

4. *Combinations*. For scenarios where more than one type of ambiguity occurs
    for a work, combine methods above, shorten wherever practical and separate
    with commas. Examples:

    - Esau (Philip Kerr novel, English)
    - Esau (Philip Kerr novel, German translation)
    - Esau (Poul Anderson short story)

### For editions and edition groups

If an edition or edition group requires disambiguation by author, the author
name(s) should be listed. Examples:

- Short Fiction (Philip K. Dick)
- Short Fiction (P. K. Wodehouse)

If an edition or edition group for the same author requires disambiguation by
language, append the language to the disambiguation. Example:

- Hamlet (William Shakespeare, English)
- Hamlet (William Shakespeare, German)

If editions are issued by multiple publishers, or multiple editions are issued
by the same publisher, no further disambiguation is applicable.

### For authors

For an ambiguous author, provide a brief description including: genre,
language, occupation, nationality, era, etc.

### For publishers

For an ambiguous publisher, provide a brief descriptions such as nationality,
speciality, language, era, etc.
