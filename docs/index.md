# Welcome to BookBrainz !

[BookBrainz](http://bookbrainz.org/) is an online encyclopaedia which contains information about published literature. Our aim is to collect and store data about every book, magazine, journal or other publication ever written and make it available to the public for free.

Like Wikipedia, our open-source project is maintained by a global community of users and we want everyone — including you! — to participate and contribute.

## Becoming an editor
All you need to do in order to start contributing to BookBrainz is to [create an account](https://bookbrainz.org/register "create an account").
The process for this will take you to the MusicBrainz website where you can create a new account, and then automatically brings you back to the BookBrainz website.

Then head over to the [Getting started](./getting-started.md) page of this user guide to learn the basics of editing in BookBrainz.

## Accessing the data
The BookBrainz data is freely available to everyone, for any use. Please see our [licensing page](https://bookbrainz.org/licensing) for more details.

Regular database dumps of our (Postgres) database can be found [at this address](http://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/bookbrainz/).

We also have an API (or webservice) under development [with live documentation](https://api.test.bookbrainz.org/1/docs/) to access the data programmatically.
