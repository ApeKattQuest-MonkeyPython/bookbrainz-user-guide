# Series 
-------
A series is a sequence of separate works, authors, editions, edition groups, or publishers with a common theme. The theme is usually prominent in the branding of the entities in the series and the individual entities will often have been given a number indicating the position in the series.

### Examples

- [The Lord of the Rings](https://test.bookbrainz.org/series/8868b54c-3d85-4067-aacc-63c3fc0c4b01)
- [Harry Potter](https://test.bookbrainz.org/series/e9ffde6e-ffa7-4fe3-b8c5-e548bcbcc938)

### Series Type
The type primarily describes what type of entity the series contains. The possible values are:

- Work 
- Author 
- Publisher
- Edition
- Edition group 

### Ordering type
The ordering type determines whether the series is ordered automatically or manually.

continue the same process for the other two works and add them to the series.

Give each works a number, indicating their sequence in the series. For example: the fellowship of the ring is first chapter of the series, we can assign it a value 1, and so on for the other two works.

Note: It is not necessary only to assign a numeric value, you can assign any character. In this case we could have assigned A, B, C instead of 1, 2, 3 or even something more descriptive like "Chapter 1" or "The First Book".

Add relationship(if any) and annotation for the series. Then finally click on the **Submit** button.

### When to use Manual as Ordering Type ?

When the ordering type is **Automatic**, the series will be ordered in ascending order of the number attribute value assigned to the works.

Using **Manual** ordering type, offers more control over the ordering of the items in the series.
You can use the drag and drop tool to order the items in the series in any way you want.

Let's see this in action.

[The Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit) is a prequel to the series The Lord of the Rings. Let's add it to the series.

Edit the series and add the work to the series.

![series editor](../images/series-12.png)

Oh! The Hobbit at bottom of the list does not match the series order. It would be better if it was at the top of the list.

How to move it to the top? 

Change the ordering type to Manual and use the drag and drop tool to move it to the top.
